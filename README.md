<b>For this application, I have used AlamofireObjectMapper library to handle the REST service and serialize the response to object. I have also used SwiftEventBus in order to handle events. Finally, I have used PureLayout in order to manipulate some constraints more easily. All of them are open source libraries under MIT license.</b>

<b>I have used MVC architectural pattern in order to have distinguished my models, views and controllers.</b>

This app includes:

<br>1)polling mechanism to update rates every couple of seconds
<br>2)spread calculation
<br>3)rate display
<br>  *only one fractional pip is displayed
<br>  *the pip and the digit to its left are highlightened
<br>4)the app looks nice on every screen, without depending on its size
<br>5)two-three examples of tests are included
